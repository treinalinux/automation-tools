## Ansible

Ansible was developed in Python and uses a data serialization format called YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), which is declarative, and brings coding for infrastructure closer to the concept of Low Code (a way to develop with little specific knowledge and little or no code).

## Terraform

Terraform is an open source "infrastructure as code" tool created by HashiCorp.

A declarative programming tool, Terraform allows developers to use a high-level configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to describe the desired end-state on-premises or cloud infrastructure to run an application. It then generates a plan to reach that end state and executes the plan to provide the infrastructure.

# Puppet

Puppet is the configuration manager and automation tool that was created in 2005 and was written in Ruby for Linux and Unix servers.
